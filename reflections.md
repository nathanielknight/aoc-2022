- had fun with chapel (it's obviously powerful and not too hard to write)
- had a bad time with the chapel compiler (unhelpful error messages, compiler
  crashes)
- made it much further than I have in previous years
- programming is fun, especially when
  - the problem is well-posed and not full of nasty edge cases
  - you can see your algorithm working (e.g. the topographic path-finding
    problem)
